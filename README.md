# Beautiful_Maths

This Project, a collection a small projects which will capture graphic views of math in a pure form; taking formulas, identities etc and exploring how they are represented visually. Really nature already provides some beautiful maths for example nautilus shells (Fibonacci numbers) and many more.

My first project will be from 1983, 'Multiple Angle Graphs'

This project started in 1983 during my year 12 studies on my schools [VAX-11/780](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX-11) computer with DEC GIGI  graphics terminal. Somewhat a huge technology jump from my first computer experience in 1982 year 11 schools [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M) system (8inch floppy, monochrome screen, DIY games in text).
